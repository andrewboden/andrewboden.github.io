        Datagram in the CIT (DITCIT) is a private hackathon targeted for athletes at Brown. With an
        ever-growing role in our lives, technology is often taken for granted. We use it everyday
        but often don't think about what's going on behind the screens. Classes in the CS department
        look great but can often be seen as scary rather than fun. Datagram aims to makes
        the area of computer science less intimidating amung the athletic community while celebrating
        technology.
